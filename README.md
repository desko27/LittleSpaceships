This is an Android game I created from the scratch as an experiment. No engines were used, just plain Java. Only most of the graphic resources were taken from the internet.

## The code

All the meaningful code is next to the `MainActivity.java` file, which is in [this folder](https://github.com/desko27/LittleSpaceships/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/desko27/littlespaceships). I built the engine in a way that kinda remembers me of my old days using Game Maker :')
